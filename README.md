Use neutron star observations to measure the equation of state (pressure(density)) of nuclear matter.

The basic methods are described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8866), although I have made some minor changes to just take the chirp mass as fixed. They were originally inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0811) on measuring the EOS from NS mass and radius observations.
